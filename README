DEFINITION

map.py :: (r1 -> r2) -> [r1] -> [r2]
    General map function.

project.py :: [col] -> [r1] -> [r2] 
    Simple map function that just selects columns.

filter.py :: (r -> Bool) -> [r] -> [r]
    Simple filter function.

groupby.py :: [col1] -> [col2] -> op -> [r1] -> [r2]
    GroupBy function.
    1st argument means group columns.
    2nd argument means value columns.
    3rd argument means an aggregation operator.

sort.py :: (r -> r -> Bool) -> [r] -> [r]

join.py :: (r1 -> r2 -> Bool) -> (r1 -> r2 -> r3) -> [r1] -> [r2] -> [r3]
    1st arg: adoption predicate.
    2nd arg: constructor.
    3rd arg: 1st input list 
    4th arg: 2nd input list

(foldl.py) :: (r2 -> r1 -> r2) -> r2 -> [r1] -> r2

(product.py) :: [r1] -> [r2] -> [r3]
    1st arg: 1st input list.
    2nd arg: 2nd input list.


VARIABLES

* r, rX means a "record" type.
* col, colX means a "column index".
* op means an aggregation function like avg, sum.


CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

pysows.py
  Common components.

map.py, project.py, sort.py, filter.py, sort.py,
groupby.py, join.py
  Command-line tools to treat csv-like streams.

util.py, relation.py, csvlike.py
  Currently unused. This supports typing.
  (String, Integer, Float, Decimal)


TODO

* support simple-type-conversion with -g option.
  for filter.py, map.py.
* support accumulate manipulation of groupby.py.
  inside -v option instead -o option.
* support typing using relation/csvlike.
* implement foldl.py.
* modify groupby.py using foldl.
* implement product.py.
* refactor command-line tools source.
  (general functionalities must be moved to pysows.py.)
* design and implement a language to implement 
  simple stream processing easily 
  using files/pipes.
